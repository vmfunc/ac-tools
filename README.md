Literally another pp map, wtf monstrata?

It's ridiculous how mappers these days abuse 80bpm 20x DS jumps and completely overmapped 1/32 snapped streams just to inflate the difficulty so pro players will play your map on stream so you can be recognized as the next "famoose" mapper.

Wow, absolutely disgusting. I hope this never makes it past qualified.

Please reconsider your entire career as a mapper.
