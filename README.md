Story:
I've been extremely high like the past 2 weeks and I've just gotten sober and now I'm noticing that I somehow have aim assist? I don't want to cheat as I want to gain skill legitimately, I've reinstalled the game like 4 times reset my drive and yet it still persists. I literally don't know what to do, I don't wanna be banned. I've checked all active tasks and closed all the ones that look suspicious, their is no random apps in startup either, I'm confused on how this even happened as I have no memory of doing anything besides just playing? Is this aim assist or am I dumb?

I’m sorry to hear that you uninstalled [Good Game] because of the [Invasive Spyware] requirement. I understand your concern about spyware, but I can assure you that [Invasive Spyware] is not spyware. It is a custom "game security" software designed by [Marketing Company Majority Owned by the CCP] to uphold the highest levels of competitive integrity for their games, such as [Good Game] and [Other Game]. [Invasive Spyware] only runs [24/7] and [Continues] running when you exit the game2. It also [Questionably] respects your privacy and data, and you can find more details about what data it uses and collects here1. [No Link]
[Invasive Spyware] is necessary to prevent [Largely Unseen Problem] in [Good Game], especially after the security breach in [Random Date]. It also ensures that all players have a fair and enjoyable gaming experience [By installing Invasive Spyware]. If you want to play [Good Game] again, you will need to enable [Invasive Spyware] on your computer. You can find more information on how to do that here3.[No Link] If you have any issues or questions, you can contact [Marketing Company Majority Owned by the CCP's] support team here1.[No Link]
I hope this helps you understand why [Invasive Spyware] is required for [Good Game]. I appreciate your feedback and I hope you have a great day.
